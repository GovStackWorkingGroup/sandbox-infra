# GovStack Sandbox Infrastructure

This repository is a part of the [GovStack Sandbox](https://govstack.gitbook.io/sandbox).

The GovStack Sandbox aims to be an isolated, safe environment simulating a small governmental e-service system (a reference implementation of the GovStack). It is a demonstration environment for learning and a technical environment for testing and developing digital government services based on the GovStack approach.

The Sandbox Infrastructure provides the lowest layer of the Sandbox â€” a Kubernetes environment for deploying and running compatible [building block](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/) implementations.
See [documentation](docs/1-main.md) for more information about setting up the infrastructure.
